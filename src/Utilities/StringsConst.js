    name: "REM Phase",
    description: "It is a sleep stage occasionally also referred to as 'paradoxical' sleep, because during this phase the awakening threshold is extremely high, despite our brain being very active. In this phase, our muscles are completely relaxed. This is crucial since it's precisely in this stage that we dream. Due to the inactivity of the muscles, we are unable to enact the movements of the dream. However, if we awaken during this phase, we remember quite well what we were dreaming. Aside from some body contractions, the only muscular activity is the rapid movement of the eyes. For this reason, this stage is also called the REM phase, acronym for Rapid Eye Movement. It's believed that the REM phase plays a fundamental role in processing lived experiences and in long-term memory consolidation."
